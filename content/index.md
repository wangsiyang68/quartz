title: Welcome to Siyang's Digital Garden
---  
My motivation of maintaining this space is simple: Learning in Public and Learning by Design.

I believe that by putting my learning notes out there in the public, this forces me to be more coherent and less lazy in writing. Besides writing for my future self, I will be presenting my learnings to the public as well. 

I want to make a habit of better consolidate my learnings. Learning is a cyclic process where old information should be continuously updated after real-life experimenting. By making it a habit to maintain my Digital Garden, I hope that it will eventually grow from a Work-In-Progress, to a slightly more complete Work-In-Progress.
