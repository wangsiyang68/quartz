Application:

Transport: process-process data transfer (TCP, which is more reliable) to provide reliability

Network: Using the one hop service by the link layer to allow multiple hops. However, it is not reliable due to packets being dropped

Link: Data transfer between **neighboring** network elements (i.e. networks from one hop away)
