Emergent behavior is **behavior of a system that does not depend on its individual parts, but on their relationships to one another**. Thus emergent behavior cannot be predicted by examination of a system's individual parts.

To reduce emergent behaviour of the many parts of the internet, we should minimize interactions between modules; [[layering]] is an approach to achieveing this goal
