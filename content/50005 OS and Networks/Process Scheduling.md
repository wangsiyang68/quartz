# Process Scheduling
---
In order to achieve [[Multiprogramming]] and [[Timesharing]], the process scheduler selects an available [[Process]] for program execution on the CPU. If there are more processes, the rest will have to wait in a queue until the CPU is free and can be rescheduled.

There are three [[Process Queue|queues]] that are maintained by the process scheduler
