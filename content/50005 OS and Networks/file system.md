## File System
---
Controls how data is stored and retrieved in a system. It is a set of rules and features applicable to determine the way the data is stored.

The purpose of a file system is to **maintain** and **organize** secondary storage. Without it, cannot tell where start and where end. It lives on the disk, usually starts from zero.

Common file systems:
1.  File allocation table (**FAT**) is supported by the Microsoft Windows OS
2.  New Technology File System (**NTFS**) is the default file system for Windows products from Windows NT 3.1 OS onward
3.  **ext4** is a file system for many Linux Distributions
4.  Universal Disk Format (**UDF**) is a vendor-neutral file system used on optical media and DVDs
5.  Hierarchical file system (**HFS**) was developed for use with Mac operating systems. HFS is succeeded by HFS+
6.  Apple File System (**APFS**) for macOS

For example, Windows can read files organized by APFS, but it cannot/doesnt know how to modify such files.
