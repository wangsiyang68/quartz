## System Call API
---
One of the most common ways to make system calls is through an API. We can write a program in a particular language and conveniently perform several [[System Call|system calls]] through the provided APIs supported by the chosen language as needed.

An API specifies:
- A set of functions that are available to an application programmer
- The parameters that are passed to each function
- the return values the programmer can expect

Examples:
- Win32 API for Windows system, written in C++
- POSIX API for POSIX-based system (all versions of UNIX), mostly written in C. Documentation [here](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/)
- Java API for programs running on JVM
