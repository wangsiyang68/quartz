# Directory Structure
---
Single level directory
Everything in the same directory yeeheet

Two level directory:
For different users, can have a separate directory for each of them

Tree structured Directory
There is only **one** path to reach each file. It is acylic structure, but just to note, not all acyclic structures are tree type because you can be acyclic and have multiple paths to reach each file

General Graph Directory
Theoretical, usually not implemented because the allowance of self reference of directories will result in a possible dangling pointer
