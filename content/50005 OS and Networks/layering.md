# Layering
---
Instead of modules interacting with each other freely, we can have N layers where each layer only interact with the layer below. This results in $O(N)$ number of links
This is an example of using the hierarchy structure to solve the problem of minimizing links

An example of how layering is done for networks is the [[Internet Protocol Stack]]
