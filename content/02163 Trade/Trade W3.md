## Free Trade -- Can it work for everyone?
- Winners and losers in free trade, but winners don't share with losers 
	- Why?
- Politically divisive
- *Everybody wants to move up the value chain -- so who's left doing the lower value chain jobs in the future?*
	- *Is it because not everyone can move up the value chain? Will there be a mismatch in expectation vs reality?*
	- *What happens if you cannot manage to get a CA in where you wanted to be in? Do you do something else instead, or do you enact protectionist policies in hope of building up your workforce to compete one day? Is it fair to be protectionist? What has been the trend in the past 20 years of globalisation with regards to this?*
		- I.e. chile having a CA in the green hydrogen fuel, but it was wiped out by the subsidies that US enjoys
			- "Global South" complained that globalization/trade has benefitted western nations in the past, and now when they don't have a CA in places that they want to have, they get to subsidize like mad and claw back the good shit
- Industrial policy
	- Is it good or bad?
	- Know that protectionist policies that have subsidies will need financing, and likely from increased tax, and hence making things more expensive
## US View: IRA
- Biden still pretty protectionist
	- IRA (Inflation Reduction Act) has still been quite protectionist, by including clauses such as local content requirement to force products to have a certain percentage of American components being masqueraded as Green policies
	- *Is the answer to climate crisis in the world, green tech or reduced consumption?*
	- *How can permaculture ideas be used to solve problems outside of agriculture?*
- Other points:
	- Being selective in who US wants to win together 
	- Reindustrialization
	- Reshoring
		- Re-introduce jobs in the value chain back into the country
## Singaporean View: CECA
- Chapter 9: Immigration and the types of professionals that are allowed smoother entry into Singapore
	- On [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India%E2%80%93Singapore_Comprehensive_Economic_Cooperation_Agreement#cite_note-mothership.sg-11), it is said that there are concerns that CECA benefits India citizens disproportionately. Why is that so?
