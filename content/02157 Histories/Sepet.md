Key idea: race and its divisions?
film analysis:
rant between orked and the friends boyfriend = 
- racism against chinese
- sexist against women who want to marry outside their race

race inequality in society
- bumiputera policy allow orked go study on lower result but jason cmi
- jason smort romantic but doing illegal jobs because lack of roles for him in society to do anws

frantz fanon book: perjaja on the di-perjaja

Paper analysis:
race-based governance (page 5)
	- Colonial origins: malay as a concept in the past was anyone who adopted the local way of life, but the colonizers put rigid concepts of origin and race into being, hence segregating people who share the same place but have different origins/belief systems, making the divide between races even more pronounced in the present day
	- Post colonial: MCIO paradigm is still being adhered to like its a rigid format, even though times have changed (why though?) not part of malaysia
