# Pre-movie thoughts:
suharto basically used communism as an excuse to create a dictatorship through fear -- anyone who acts in a way that is not to his liking has the danger of being labelled as a communist and threatened with lots of violence

# Film Description
a man watches another man bragging abt how he killed suspected communists
an old couple washing up 
an old woamn saying that it was calm in aceh while saying that communists were killed 
back with the family -- father singing but he lost his teeth
ridiculousness of american interview -- indonesian person interviewd sayed that some were asked to be killed
possible conflict of interst -- goodyear employees union
such irony during education -- thank the heroes for democracy but anoyone who rebels against the state is put in jail
sexual violence against females by perpetrators as well
living side by side with the killers 
resignation -- only god can punish the pepetrators, no point raising it now
intersperesed with the act of killing clips -- MC watching blankly at the footage
talking to a survivor from snake river now
- no one even dared to watch when people were brought to be killed
- another one who thinks that the past shouldnt be opened- he has accepted the past..somehow
stunning watching eldery bapaks describing how killings were done at snake river
put in parallel with the MC and another escaped victim retracing the route to execution -- MC looks visibly distraught while the victim repeatedly asks for forgiveness from god
now MC interviews the death squad leader inong
- says that most villagers were scared of him as most were communist
- harrowing account of drinking salty and sweet human blood to avoid going crazy
- not allowed to cut more than once but allowed to cut evil people
- bristles after MC asks too many questions and tries to tell him that the version of events he was told were false
two kids were talking -- the girls tooth was pulled loose even though it wasnt loose
there were trees deadass growing out of the tomb
now interviewing a village leader who says that maerica shoul reward them with a trip to that country -- because they were taught by them to hate the communists
- constrats with videos of people who reconciles after a war or atrocity to acknolwedge their wrongdoings but perhaps its because 
- does not show any remorse when he says that he is avoiding his moral responsibility
- says that he would kill if 

Sponteous action of the people
- video of two people saying that while the army was behind all this
- now he interviews the kmoando aksi
- ends with komando aksi head threatening to kill him unless he changes perkaii

his wife admonishes him for meeting the killers
- i guess the fear was not unfounnded when listening to how the killers bristling aginst him

interviewing his uncle now...who was a prisoner guard...shaggggggggg
- says that he was under komando aksi which was under the army
	- kind of everyone is pushing responsibility around person saying is following army orders, army says that it was a peoples revolution
- non religious people are worthy of being killed...shitttt
- MC's mum didnt know about him

now interviewing a father-daughter duo 
- father participated in the killings
- man says its getting late when MC says that his brother was killed (but window was bright sike)
- daughter was shocked when she heard her father talk about the killings and drinking blood

now watching a man who sketched and made a book about the...killings?
- yikes writing a book???????????
- interviewing the family
- idea of opening the past wounds and keeping the peace  #todo rewatch this

**Some Ideas**

maybe the teacher wants to teach these so that the next generation would accept the past as it is and not question the history -- peace over truth? feels like a very asian trait 

feels like everyone at least knew that they were doing something bad, everyone was trying to avoid responsibility 
- Most people were probably not bad -- after they killed the people, they had to deflect responsibility and cling on to false narratives in order not to feel bad
- some people after all dont look so different from the victims, they could have very easily gone on to the other sidei

but uncovering the truth is important to teach people to be critical so that we do not repeat this in the future

What are some of the younger generasi's thoughts when they watch films like this?
