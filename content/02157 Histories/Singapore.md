Migrant Labour
- throwback to 2020 when alot of migrant labour were living in deploarble conditions

Journal review:
- Relationship between **debt** and **migration**
- lots of debt were incurred when migrants come to singapore to work
	- There are **'silently' incurred forms of debt**
		- Debt via monthly salary deductions
		- Usually borne by female maids from Indonesia
	- More **'resonant' forms of debt** that are acquired upfront
		- Usually borne by male construction workers in Bangladesh
	- This spectrum of migrant indebtedness tends to run along gendered lines
	- **Result in** 
		- implications for migrants' salaries and remitting capacity
		- Job mobility while in destination country
		- enable and constraining migrants
	- **Idea**: migrant indebtedness needs to be read in conjuction with many other factors that can shape migrants experiences and ultimately their life trajectories

- work is often 3D (dirty, dangerous and degrading), and precarity and unfreedom
	- High degree of dependency upon employers
		- Reason: migrants are far removed from their usual social support networks
	- Broken promises
		- Kamal was given three one year contracts despite being offered a two year contract each time
		- every time coming back need to pay an additional lump sum, adding on to debt
	- Silent Debt
		- is purely transactional, easier job mobility
		- as described by una who escaped and returned each time she faced trouble
- Gender makes in difference in the debt experience of the migrant workers
	- Income decutions and a nominal allowance coincided with the women's limited social and spatial mobility, making entry point to migration a particularly difficult time
