# East Timor
## TO NOTE
---
when writing essay
- Pls remember to apply reading to the movie, analyse how they are related. also dont just repeat what happened in the movie
- DO NOT critique on what should or should not have been done. It is incorrect to critique on the geopolitics of the past with the current lens. Try to instead critique what was lacking/onesided/missing/could be improved with the movie or the reading
## Interesting points
- Militia men and civil war
- Austrailia exploiting Timor oil
- wifes campaign for independence in the film and irl

Interesting difference: east timor did not wage a war of independence against the portugeuese, got it quite late in 1975

many people fought in the battle of timor, death of 40k to 70k of east timorese

three camps in april 1974
- timorese democratic union (stay in portugal)
- fretilin (full independence)
- APODETI (integration with Indo)

## FRETILIN
