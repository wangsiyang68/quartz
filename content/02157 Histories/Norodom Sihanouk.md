# Norodom Sihanouk
---
A key figure of Cambodian statehood since WW2 ended. Despite his mixed legacy due to 1) political suppression in his first reign, 2) his initial patronage of [[Khmer Rouge]] and 3)  alignment with the Khmer Rouge during Vietnamese occupation, "No monarch in modern times has embodied the life and fate of his country so completely as Norodom Sihanouk." by [Martin Woollacock of The Guardian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norodom_Sihanouk#cite_note-259). 

Perhaps his influence can be likened to that of Lee Kuan Yew, a nationalistic statesman who had great influence over his country with his one-party rule, well-loved by his people, and a blip in his legacy with the Khmer Rouge alliance

## Pre WW2:
Put on kingship by the french before world war two ahead of his father

## Post WW2
Gave the kingship to his father to become a polical leader
While he sided with the West in a bid to avoid Vietnamese encroachment, he also aligned himself with the Vietnamese to allow Ho Chi Minh to traverse through Cambodian territory in the Ho Chi Minh Trail

## Khmer Rouge Era
Allowed Pol Pot to come to power and was ceremonial Head of State. In 1976, he abdicated and was put under house arrest until 1979 when the Khmer Rouge left.

## FUNCINPEC Era
Created a resistance movement against the Vietnamese supported PRK government, known as FUNCINPEC. Eventually sided with other elements, including the Khmer Rouge to form an Anti-Vietnamese alliance.
