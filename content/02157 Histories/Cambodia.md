**Influence from Thailand and Vietnam**
Vietnam took over cochinchina/mekong river part, which has a significant Khmer population till today

**Lon Nol Era**
Lon Nol allows the US to bomb the crap out of Cambodia. North Vietnamese begin attacking Cambodia, setting up a structure that helps the Khmer Rouge come into power. However, Khmer Rouge eventually rid itself of Vietnamese influence

**Link between Pol Pot and Sihanouk**
Pol Pot came to power also on the influence of Sihanouk, and he spent his time in the palace while the Khmer Rouge wrecked havoc across Cambodia

**Some questions:**
What is the assessment of Sihanouk's legacy?
