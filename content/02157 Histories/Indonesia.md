- Fight for independence between 1945 and 1949, ended on the last day of 49
Suharto: Authoritarian leader
- Debatable/dubious as an economic leader
	- In the 1960s, the per capita income was the same as in 1940
	- Coup follows in 1965
- Led the Non-Aligned Movement in ithe international community
	- Led to distrust by the United States
- Guided Democracy ('quasi-democracy: daddy knows best')
	- Was more of a transition to dictatorship 
- Created NASAKOM, which institutionalized the PKI in government
	- PKI supported it
	- Not really communist; he was just being strategic in trying to keep peace with everyone

## Suharto
- Was a quiet military man behind the scenes
- Avowedly anti-communist
	- Very violently against communists, conducting purges of many enemies
	- What really happened in 1965 October 1 Coup?
		- Many top generals were killed: Need a top military man to take control
		- Was not killed by communists as widely spoken, but it was more of a internal military coup and not communist 
		- However, Suharto was not the one behind the killings

## Supersemar
HOTO document from sukarno to suharto
actually document not found so its disputed whether power was really handed over
- soekardjo wildarjito wrote about the handover
	- was a body guard for sukarno 

After the act of killing was released, some senators in the US decided to check the records which showed that US was involved in the mass murder of 1965

joshua oppenheimer's second film addresses the concerns the criticism that the first film was too killer centric (i.e. killers took too much narratives)
- Oppenheimer falsely told the killers that they will be doing a film about the killings, which made them divulge their secrets about killing people

the act of living has nice succicnt testimony of killers
