Massive de-urbanization
Many of RIthy Panh's family died

took away all belongings clothes are turned black people are segrated according to age and sex hair of females were cut

the angkar organization dominated the society
- eg a study session to reconstruct yourself
- great leap forward plan to produce three times more of crops while moving the earth
- shared everything --- our only belonging was a spoon?
- very jarring contrast of moon launch vs moving the earth mechanically and a large group of 30 people trying to move a stupidly big stone
- juxtaposition between two kinds of great leaps

 his father one day decided to stop eating because he said he was a man...?

no more private property money was strewn everywhere money was not used anymore there are now no more problems
what the fuck is a car doing in the middle of a rice paddy field  

a child denounces his mother for taking mangoes 

jarring interlude of the introduction of brother who was a musician 

people flying in the sky are the loved ones who pass away?

filmmaker and his friends who criticised the lack of equality  
dehumanisation startnns with hunger, disease and decay 

diffficult to revolt when all you have is black lothes and spoon

the same poor still dig earth today?

QUotes
spades your pan, rice field is your paper
those who we cannot reeducate, we will fightl ike enemies

QUestions:
justified invasion of cambodia and vietnam?
