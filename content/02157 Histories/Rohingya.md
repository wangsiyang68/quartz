# Rohingya
---
Context: myanmar leadership thinks that the rohingya people are people that dont have rights to live in the country as they are immigrants that only arrived recently; but the rohingya assert that they have been in the country pre-british colonial era

More context: Refugees have definitions and rights: e.g. non-refoulement
- However, all ASEAN countries except Cambodia and Philippines have not signed the 1967 Protocol that extended the Eurocentric "1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees"

Historical context:
- During the colonial period, muslims from bengal emigrated in large numbers
- During WW2, Burma generally aligned itself with the Japanese
	- However, there were some parts that were not loyal to the Japanese.
		- Arakan state that was closer to bangladesh had a large scale communal violence
	- After independence, there was a mujahedeen insurgency
		- However, there were still representation and rights of Rohingya
	- After military coup in 1962, rights were stripped away from Rohingya
		- In 1982, the citizenship law made rohingya stateless

Super current context:
- The government in exile (NUG) is now reaching out to Rohingya community for support, but the Rohingya were still widely persecuted
