**Stock Exchanges hold immense power**
- Organize alot of things along the value chain
	- For example, for the ETF (like S&P 500), stock market can set the rules of who's in and whos out
	- Allow/Ban High Frequency Trading (HFT)
		- Many stock exchanges ban it but some allow it (US/UK)
- Have better knowledge of the market data that is only proprietary
	- Can anticipate and make better decisions
		- Monopoly pricing power
	- Can re-sell this data because its key to investment decisions
		- Bloomberg Terminal has an annual fee of 24k
- Have conflicting interests as a private profit driven company

**Credit Card's reluctant role in regulating the web**
- Could government linked platforms replace these credit firms 
- Could bitcoin overtake this as well? 
	- Privacy and freedom over your payment choices
- why would the banks want to apply pressure?
	- want to be seen as being in line with the moral/societal norms

**Credit Card swipe fees**
- Can be a deterrence against digital transactions
- largest of which is interchange fee (?)
	- whats that?
- There can be different swipe fees for different credit cards
	- But merchants can only accept all or none of the credit cards because they use the same network
	- So merchants will increase prices of their products, but those with lower interchange fees will be paying a larger proportion of the burden because the interchange fees will be used to fund the rewards programs that they are not really part of
- Some legislation
	- To address this, US wants to make the credit payment system look more like the debit payment system, and allow merchants to choose between multiple networks, such as the cheaper of the lot instead of being stuck to one 

**SWIFT**
- Is a consortium
	- **But is it related to VISA/Mastercard (e.g. a competitor)**
- Is a messaging platform
	- It depends on intermediaries to work because most dont have 
- Used to be telex last time which took long to work
	- And its much cheaper too
- A competitor would be SPFS by Russia
	- China also created its system CIPS
- However, such competitors find it difficult to disrupt them
	- But it is also depends who is in the system, and if the big/commonly used banks are in your systems, then you win
	- This is due to network effects, where the more people use a network, the better it is
- Crypto has cons to avoid this because
	- it is clear for everyone to see who are the payments made to?

**DBS Recent Fuckups**
- Equinix is due to blame but 
	- Singapore requires banks to ensure any unscheduled outages that affect their operations or customer services not exceed four hours within a one-year period.
	- While the outage had occurred due to a technical issue at an Equinix Inc. data center used by the lenders, MAS said it expects banks to have contractual agreements with data center providers that incorporate its requirements on system availability.
