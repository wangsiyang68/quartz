#### Network models
`"0.0.0.0"`: When you bind a socket to the IP address "0.0.0.0," it means that the socket is bound to all available network interfaces on the local machine. It essentially allows the socket to listen for incoming packets on all available network interfaces, including localhost and any other network interfaces on the system.

Packet sniffing, which involves capturing and analyzing network packets as they traverse a network interface, typically requires superuser or administrator privileges for several reasons:

1. **Access to Raw Network Frames**: Sniffing tools need access to raw network frames, which include the data link layer headers (e.g., Ethernet frames). To capture these frames directly from the network interface, superuser privileges are required. Ordinary users do not have the necessary permissions to access these low-level network interfaces.
