## Cold Miss
- Obvious
## Capacity Miss
- cannot access because overwritten, too much variables being accessed compared to the cache space
	- Decrease memory chunk in cache access (how?) or buy more RAM? ahaha
## Conflict Miss
- Enough space in cache but the same data keep being written to a non empty portion of the cache, resulting in a old data in cache being overwritten, end up missing old data
	- Change the memory access pattern
