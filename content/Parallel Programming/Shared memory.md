## Benefits 
There are several scenarios where saving data in shared memory instead of registers can be beneficial in [[CUDA]] programming. 

Key Idea: Registers are used to store the state of the program, not to store useful variables used by the GPU. Here are three common scenarios:

1.  Data reuse: If a computation involves accessing the same data multiple times within a thread block, storing that data in shared memory can reduce redundant memory accesses. Shared memory provides lower latency and higher bandwidth compared to global memory, which can significantly improve performance in cases where data reuse is high.
    
2.  Inter-thread communication: When threads within a thread block need to communicate or share data with each other, shared memory can serve as a shared storage space. By storing data in shared memory, threads can efficiently exchange information and collaborate on computations. This can be particularly useful in algorithms such as parallel reduction or stencil computations.
    
3.  Resource limitations: Each CUDA thread has a limited number of registers available for storing variables. If a kernel uses a large number of registers per thread, it may result in register spilling, where some variables need to be stored in global memory. In such cases, moving some of the variables to shared memory can free up registers and avoid the need for register spilling, improving overall performance.

## Calculation of Shared Memory Usage
1. Given [[Threadblocks|threadblock]] size, find the amount of threads in a block.
2. Calculate the number of thread blocks that the GPU can launch concurrently (#Max threadblock/ threadblock size)
3. Calculate the size that each threadblock will store in the [[Shared Memory]]
	- For example, in the matrix multiplication example, the threadblock will call a threadblock sized portion of both matrix A and B. So the space utilized in shared memory will be tb_size * 2 * 4 bytes 
4. Calculate the occupancy by multiplying the # of threadblocks with the size that each threadblock uses.
	- Note that need to ensure that total shared memory usage is less than the maximum size of the shared memory
