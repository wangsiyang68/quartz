Key Assumption: what does it mean in layman terms?
Use log in the assignment instead of the actual stuff

Another type of regularization specific to this:
- Use Laplace Smoothing, basically adding a probability (really small value) to each word so that you dont have the problem that a word has 0 probablility of being spam/not spam given that it is not present in training data
