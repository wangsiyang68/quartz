Different types of UI
- Non Diegetic
	- Similar to a heads up display, kinda like a fighter jet helmet with stats on the perimeter of the view
- Diegetic
	- Diegetic UI is **UI made to look like it is entirely part of the game's narrative**.
	- Sits between the player and the gameworld
- Meta
	- information gets presented in a way that is part of the story
- Spatial

** Need to differentiate between what you know vs what the character knows

Tips
- Text that is white overlay >> usually most scenes are not full white
- Use inbuilt library for interaction manager (trigger event when interacting  with NPC)
- Blur out background
- Canvas on background
- Relevant difficulty is good, but not irrelevant hassles
