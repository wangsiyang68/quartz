A way to analyse how game attracts people
Octalysis can be applied into segments (endgame, mid-phase, discovery) of the game (2nd dimension)
Octalysis can further applied for different sections of the game (3rd dimension)
## 1. Meaning
There is a sense of being greater than yourself since you always do the same shit generally. Usually accomplished with complex and involved storyline, or a sense of beginners luck (casino)

## 2. Development/Accomplishment
Feel desire to complete challenges, via validation from badges/trophies to remind them of their achievements
There needs to be a challenge so that the accomplishment is meaningful

## 3. Empowerment
Receive validation from creating masterpieces that displays their creativity or uniqueness

Example: Instagram Likes, Minecraft to build world/crazy computers/adders and ur minecraft server gets popular 

## 4. Ownership
As described. It looks good, and it attracts people who like to hoard things

Example: skins that dont have any in-game effect but cost quite a bit and look pretty

## 5. Social Influence
Not the same as Empowerment, where you get respect for the good work that you have done in your masterpiece

Relatability from nostalgia is a way to achieve this

Example of this must be in the online 

## 6. Scarcity
Get rare shit. It doesnt even look that pretty, but its idea of scarcity 

## 7. Unpredictability/Curiosity
Unpredictability -> stock market game like FPS?
Curiosity -> Can't wait to know the next episode

## 8. Loss/Avoidance
Kind of like sunk cost fallacy -- don't want to quit to admit that whatever done was futile
Also FOMO
