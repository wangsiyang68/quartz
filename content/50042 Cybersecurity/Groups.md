# Groups
---

## Definition
---
A group consists of:
1. A set of elements
2. An operation * that combines two elements to a third element
3. Operation * (e.g. + or -) must have the following properties:
	 - Closure (Result of operation is within the set)
	 - Associativity (Order of evaulation does not change result)
		 - e.g. a + b = b + a
	 - Identity (the set contains an element i, such that i * a = a for all a in the set)
	 - Invertibility (there is a y for each x such that $x * y = 1, y * x = 1$) 
		 - e.g. Z and +0 0
## Order
---
The order of a group G is |G|, the number of its elements
The order of a value **a** is the min number of times you need to do the operation in order to reach the identity value

## Cyclic groups
---
Generated from one element g with invertible associative operation,
- g is the generator of G
- it contains an element _g_ such that every other element of the group may be obtained by repeatedly applying the group operation to _g_ or its inverse.
