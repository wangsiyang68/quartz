Questions:
Besides the CTFs, how did he learn all these skills given that it was not taught in school
- read reports, ask questions why things are designed this way
- guessing is a legitimate strategy
- Learn man page
- trying different constraints when building smth to learn different tools

Certs to get after getting into cybersecurity
OSWE, OSCP, PortSwigger

what CTFs are good in SG to join for beginnerZZ
- google beginner's quest
- Cyber League (by Singaporeans)
- Div0 discord
how do you stay ahead with the trends given that it changes so fast
- Read reddit
