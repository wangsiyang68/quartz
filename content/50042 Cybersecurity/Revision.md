# Outline
- Week 1: Pre-modern Ciphers, basic security concepts
	- ~~Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability~~
	- ~~Privacy, Authenticity, Non-repudiation~~
	- ~~Caesar's Cipher/Substitution Cipher/Vignere Cipher~~
		- Attack: Frequency Analysis
	- ~~Transposition Ciphers~~
	- ~~Subsitutions on binary data have $2^n!$ possible keys~~
	- **One Time Pad**
		- Proof: Brute force failure
		- Attack: When re-use key
- Week 2 & 3: Hash Functions
	- ~~Cryptographic Hash Functions:~~
		- ~~Preimage resistance~~
		- ~~Second preimage resistance~~
		- ~~Collision resistance~~
		- ~~Random oracle~~
	- ~~MD5 Construction~~
		- ~~Rough idea (diagram form)~~
		- **Insecure MD Constructions:**
			- IV = 0
			- Plainly XOR-ing each block
			- Length Extension Attack
				- Fix: Hash hashvalue again with the message
				- Fix: Truncate the output
	- ~~Birthday paradox: $O(2^{n/2})$ , where n = bit length of hash value~~
	- ~~Commitment schemes ~~
		- ~~Idea: Send hash value first (committment), followed by message. Think of email chess game~~
		- ~~Attack: Invert commitment~~
		- ~~Fix: Cryptographic padding (i.e. in SHA1)~~
	- **Message Authentication Code**
		- ~~Naive MAC constructions (secret as prefix or suffix)~~
			- ~~Attack: Length Extension/re-use MAC if second preimage is found~~
			- Fix: HMAC
	- ~~Secret storage (password)~~
		- ~~Attack: Rainbow Tables~~
		- ~~Fix: Salt~~

- Week 4: Block Ciphers
	- ~~Properties: Confusion and Diffusion~~
	- ~~Covered Ciphers: DES, AES, PRESENT~~
	- ~~Block Cipher Modes (i.e. How to use safely for message > 1 block length)~~
		- ~~ECB mode~~
			- ~~Attack: Does not remove image fully as same values give the same hashvalues~~
		- ~~Other modes ~~
			- ~~CTR, OFB, CFB, CBC~~
			- ~~Parallel in encryption and decryption?~~
	- **Nonce**
- Week 5: Modular Arithmetics
	- Groups, Rings, Fields
		- Extension fields are especially used in cryptography
	- Multiplicative inverse
		- Euler's Extended Theorem

- Week 6: DHKE
	- DHKE 
		- Procedure, how is Modular Arithmetics used?
		- Discrete Logarithm problem
		- Square-And-Multiply algorithm
- Week 8: RSA
	- Encryption
		- Procedure
		- Proof
		- Attack: Malleabilty
		- Fix: Hashing and Padding (OAEP)
	- Digital Signatures
		- Naive implementation
			- Attack 1: multiply two signatures to generate valid signature
			- Attack 2: reverse engineer message by generating signature first
			- Fix: Sign a hash value
			- Fix: Mixing Operation Modes
		- Man in the Middle Attack
			- Attack 3: Active attacker
			- Fix: Certificates with PKI/WOT
				- Centralized, CA tier list, each vouching for intermediate
				- Decentralized, Web of Trust
