Related to a topic called grey-level, which refer to the brightness of a pixel in a graysccale image

Can be useful in finding out some details, especially when creating a discrete graph of each discrete range of brightness (x-axis) against its probability (y-axis)
- Can learn if this image is generally bright or dark?
- Can be used for image segmentation, should the image be cut into two different sections if theres a bright and dark section
