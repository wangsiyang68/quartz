Objective:
- Understanding colourimetry (the subcomponent colours of a colour) is important for understanding imaging devices
- CIE XYZ and CIE illuminants will be key in understanding colour imaging and processing

There is a difference between CIE XYZ and CIE xyY
- the small x and y referes to the same x and y in XYZ
- however, the big Y refers to the perceived **brightness** of the colour
- xyY can be converted back into XYZ using some formulas (arbitrary?)
