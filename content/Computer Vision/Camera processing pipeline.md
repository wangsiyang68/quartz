- The pipeline is present to achieve a photoshop like effect
- The color filter array on the camera filters the light into three primaries

- Imagining sensor
	- a layer of microlens to help increase light collection on the sensor
	- More green microlens to increase sensitivity to green light

- Signal amplification
	- Imaging sensor signal is amplifiedi
	- Related to camera ISO settings

- White Balance (related to [[Colour Constancy]])

- Demosaicing process (denoising the image, still an unsolved problem)
	- Get the rgb of all values (?) what does that mean

- Color space transform

- Tone mapping (**impt!**)
	- Part of the photoshop in the camera
	- One of the final stages 

- JPEG Compression

- Metadata
	- In the exchangeable image file format (exif)
		- Date/Time
