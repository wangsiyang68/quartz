- Not enough pixels/samples to fully reconstruct the pattern from a low quality to high quality
	- See the Moire Effect
	- Intuition: trying to view a low quality image at a larger image

How to overcome? (Anti-Aliasing methods)
1. Oversampling
	- Seems obvious, but sometimes not physically possible to actually capture more frames per second
2. Smooth a signal first 
	- This will help to remove some of the details that will cause aliasing
