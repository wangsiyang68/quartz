- The claim that you can reconstruct almost any equation with a summation of a trigo function
- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a faster algorithm to compute DFT (Discrete) equation

How does it work?
- Multiply the Fourier Transform of an Image with the Fourier Transform of a convolution filter, then apply inverse fourier transform on it to get the equivalent result of passing a convolution filter through the image

Why use it?
- Is an alternative to convolution with filters
	- Convolution filters are working in the spatial domain, while Fourier Transform is w
- Can be faster at times
	- (which times?)

Related to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem: How much samples are needed?
- How does Nyquist Sampling allow the correct sampling of an image

Things I dont know:
- why is this so?
- Difference between FFT and DFT?
- what are the equations that you cannot get?
- What is the frequency domain?
- Theres an inverse fourier transform?
- what is the graph thing with dots on it?
